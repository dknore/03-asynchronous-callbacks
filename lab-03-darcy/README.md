# Project Name:  Parallel File Processing

**Author**: Darcy Knore<br>
**Version**: 1.0.0

### Overview
<!-- Problem domain -->
Creating a Reader module takes in an array of three file paths and resolve a mapped array of strings loaded from each file using an error-first callback. 
- The string data should be in the same order as the file path data (mapped).
- If an error occurs it should immediatly reject the error using the callback and stop execution.
